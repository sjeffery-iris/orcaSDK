/**
 * @class ModbusClientApplication
 * @brief Base implementation of a Modbus client application layer.
 *
 * To add a function code in a derived class:
 *
 * 1. Add the function code's name and code number (in hex) to a public function code enum in the derived class.
 *
 * 2. Add the expected length of the function code's response to the function_code_parameters.h file if it is known.
 *    If the length is variable, don't define it. Instead, calculate it in the implementation of the get_app_reception_length function.
 *
 * 	  Other useful definitions pertaining to the function code may be added here as well, such as valid data ranges.
 *
 * 3. Add a case returning the expected length to the implementation of the get_app_response_length function.
 *    If the length is unknown until response reception, return -1.
 *
 * 4. Add a private function ( "function_code_name_fn()" ) to the derived class that loads transmission with the properly formatted message and then calls send_transaction.
 *    Return a 1 if the function is successful, return a 0 if an exception occurs.
